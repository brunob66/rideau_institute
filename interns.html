            The Rideau Institute provides opportunities for students and recent graduates who want to gain hands-on experience in a non-governmental organization with a focus on foreign and defence policy. Our mission is to help revitalize Canada’s peacekeeping, diplomatic peacemaking and peacebuilding roles in the world, through creative, innovative and inclusive multilateralism, strengthening the UN capacity for conflict prevention1 and peaceful conflict resolution and the progressive enhancement of international law.

            We advocate for made-in-Canada policies that recognize the interdependence of the global community, and the equal right of all peoples to peace, security and justice.
           
            At all times, the Rideau Institute has unpaid positions for volunteers and interns from accredited institutions. Each academic term and in the summer months, we typically have one full-time “anchor” intern (four or five days per week) who is receiving course credit for the internship. In addition, we might also have two or three interns working at least two days per week. Volunteers typically contribute on an “as required” basis or may dedicate one day per week to specific administrative and donor-related activities.
           
            The Institute blends research and analysis with media and Internet communications techniques as it advances its policy agenda for Canada. Officially, the Rideau Institute is a non-partisan, independent policy-relevant research and advocacy think-tank in Ottawa. Unofficially, it is known as one of the most active and influential progressive policy-focused foreign policy organizations in town.
           
            Typically, the Institute will be busy with its extremely active social engagement program of social media posts and website blogs. Another key activity is preparing the regular direct mail and email campaigns to engage its 20,000 supporters. In addition, the President will be launching reports commissioned by the Rideau Institute, speaking at, and participating in, conferences and roundtables, engaging with the media through articles and interviews, testifying before Parliamentary Committees, interacting with Members of Parliament, policy makers and officials, and working with other likeminded non-government organizations to advance our progressive policy agenda.
           
            Peggy Mason, the Institute’s president, describes the experience like this: “We are a small, tightly knit organization, and while it can a bit hectic at times – it is an exciting workplace where everyone helps out when needed. We want our interns and volunteers to be ready to “pitch in wherever needed” as we work help give Canada a stronger, fairer, more inclusive voice on the world stage.

                I am stepping into my fourth year at the University of Toronto, specializing in Political Science and majoring in Philosophy. As an experienced grassroots organizer, I have supported and led human rights campaigns covering a plethora of topics, including the “migrant crisis”, access to education, environmental justice, and feminist peacebuilding. I have a keen interest in conflict prevention and resolution - with the Rideau Institute, I will focus on discourse surrounding <i>rethinking security</i> and identifying developing pathways towards a global security approach that is capable of meeting the challenges of today.
