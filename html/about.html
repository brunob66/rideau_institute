      The Rideau Institute was founded in October of 2006 (federally incorporated as the Rideau Institute on International Affairs) and commenced operations in January 2007. It is a registered non-profit organization, and is located in Ottawa on the historic Sparks Street Mall, one block from Parliament Hill. Its modest offices are in the Hope Building overlooking the Office of the Prime Minister (PMO) and the Privy Council.

      The Rideau Institute’s primary activities are independent policy relevant research and analysis, advocacy and social engagement to assist decision makers, opinion leaders and the general public to knowledgeably participate in the national debate on foreign, defence and national security policy.

        <h5>Individual Donations</h5>
        More than a thousand individual Canadians make donations to the Rideau Institute and its affiliated project, Ceasefire.ca with its 20,000 peace supporters.

        Ceasefire.ca is a community outreach and organizing project that primarily uses the Internet to facilitate public education and advocacy on contemporary foreign and defence policy issues.

        Larger donations can be made to the Rideau Institute Research Fund (a charitable fund registered with Tides Canada) which can issue a charitable receipt. (Please email operations@rideauinstitute.ca or pmason@rideauinstitute.ca for further information on this option).
        <h5>Special Project Funding</h5>
        The Rideau Institute occasionally receives funding for specific projects, often from a single institution or foundation. These projects can range from a single conference to a multi-year educational project. The project is conducted under the auspices of the Rideau Institute, or through a collaboration between the Rideau Institute and the funding institution. The Rideau Institute does not receive project funding from any level of government.
